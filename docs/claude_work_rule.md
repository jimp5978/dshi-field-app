Please follow these instructions and save them in memory.

1. Create and modify folders and files for the E:\DSHI_RPA\APP folder.
2. Please check the Internet search for preferences and installations on my computer before installing them.
3. If you don't have enough grounds during work or if the information is uncertain, never make it up arbitrarily and specify "I don't know" or "I'm not sure."  
4. Before answering, verify the possible information step by step, and mark any ambiguous or unclear source as "uncertain."  
5. Finally, complete a concise answer using only solid information. If speculation is inevitable, state "guess".  
6. If your inquiry is ambiguous or you need more information, first ask for more of your context or details. (Important)
7. Don't conclude with conviction that something has not been confirmed, but provide evidence together if necessary. (Important)
8. When writing the code and modifying the code, add a debug content so that it can be checked during the test, and ask for a test after restarting the flask and ruby server.
9. I will forward the error message that comes out after the test, but please check what is stored in ruby -> E:\DSHI_RPA\APP\test_app\debug.log, flask -> E:\DSHI_RPA\APP\flask_debug.log.
10. If you created Im's data & files for the test, please delete them after the test.
11. The conversation with me is in Korean, and I am Korean.
